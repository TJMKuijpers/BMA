Alexander", "DOI": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.120740", "Date": "1 March 2021", "Summary": "A novel combinatorial chemistry-topography screening platform, the ChemoTopoChip, is used here to identify materials suitable for bone regeneration by screening 1008 combinations in each experiment for human immortalized mesenchymal stem cell (hiMSCs) and human macrophage response. The osteoinduction achieved in hiMSCs cultured on the \u201chit\u201d materials in basal media is comparable to that seen when cells are cultured in osteogenic media, illustrating that these materials offer a materials-induced alternative to osteo-inductive supplements in bone-regeneration. Some of these same chemistry-microtopography combinations also exhibit immunomodulatory stimuli, polarizing macrophages towards a pro-healing phenotype. Maximum control of cell response is achieved when both chemistry and topography are recruited to instruct the required cell phenotype, combining synergistically.

This is effectively a combination of the polymer microarray approach and the TopoChip platforms to facilitate identification of synergistic chemistry-topography combinations, and elucidation of structure-function relationships between cells and material cues. The chemistries were chosen from libraries of (meth)acrylate and (meth)acylamide monomers to provide maximum chemical diversity. The monomers are used to functionalize the surface of topographically molded chips, which minimizes differences in material compliance between the different chemistries. To identify materials that can direct hiMSC differentiation towards an osteoblastic lineage and that induce human macrophages polarization towards a pro-healing M2 phenotype, we first investigated the osteoinductive potential of the materials."}, "CellCulture": {"Name": "Cell culture", "Cell_type": "hMSC", "Passage_number": "3 different passage numbers", "Medium": {"Type": "Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium", "Medium": "Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium", "Serum": "10% Fetal Bovine Serum", "Antibiotics": "1% Penicillin and 1% Streptomycin", "Medium_components": "L-Glutamine", "Medium_components_concentration": "1%"}}, "CellCulture2": {"Name": "Cell culture", "Cell_type": "Monocytes", "Passage_number": "-", "Medium": {"Type": "RPMI-1640 medium", "Medium": "RPMI-1640 medium", "Serum": "10% Fetal Bovine Serum", "Antibiotics": "Penicillin and Streptomycin", "Medium_components": "L-Glutamine", "Medium_components_concentration": "2 mM"}}, "ImagingExperiment": {"Name": "Imaging experiment", "Type": "hMSC Immunofluorescence imaging", "Labels": {"Label_1": {"First_antibody": "human ALP antibody", "Second_antibody": "Appropriate secondary antibody in the green channel", "Target": "ALP", "Fluorescent dye": "sc137213, Santa Cruz Biotech", "Excitation_wavelength": "-", "Emission_wavelength": "-"}, "Label_2": {"First_antibody": "Alpha-tubulin", "Second_antibody": "Appropriate secondary antibody in the red channel", "Target": "Alpha-tubulin", "Fluorescent dye": "PA120988, Invitrogen", "Excitation_wavelength": "-", "Emission_wavelength": "-"}, "Label_3": {"First_antibody": "-", "Second_antibody": "-", "Target": "Nucleus", "Fluorescent dye": "NucBlue Fixed Cell ReadyProbes", "Excitation_wavelength": "-", "Emission_wavelength": "-"}}}, "ImagingExperiment2": {"Name": "Imaging experiment", "Type": "Macrophage Immunofluorescence imaging", "Labels": {"Label_1": {"First_antibody": "human TNF-alpha", "Second_antibody": "Rhodamine-x goat anti-mouse IgG;", "Target": "M1 polarization indicator", "Fluorescent dye": "-", "Excitation_wavelength": "-", "Emission_wavelength": "-"}, "Label_2": {"First_antibody": "anti-human IL-10 ", "Second_antibody": "Alexa flour-647 goat anti-rabbit IgG", "Target": "M2 polarization indicator", "Fluorescent dye": "-", "Excitation_wavelength": "-", "Emission_wavelength": "-"}, "Label_3": {"First_antibody": "-", "Second_antibody": "-", "Target": "Nucleus", "Fluorescent dye": "DAPI", "Excitation_wavelength": "-", "Emission_wavelength": "-"}}}}, "Study_results": {"BiomaterialsScreen": {"Name": "hMSC ChemoTopoChip screening", "Description": "A diverse range of hiMSC morphologies and attached cell numbers were seen across the ChemoTopoChip.
