Some of these patterned surfaces have been based on non-fouling natural surfaces. Since no systematic high throughput screens have been published at this date, we compared the patterns of bacterial attachment to the 26 natural surfaces against TopoChip imprints. P. aeruginosa was chosen as the model bacterium as it is an environmentally ubiquitous microorganism that readily adheres to natural and engineered surfaces. This microorganism is highly problematic in a clinical infection context as it forms multiantibiotic-resistant biofilms on implanted medical device.", "Study_design": [{"Name": "Biomaterials screen", "Type": "Natural surface screen", "Design": "Surface", "Feature_scale": "micrometer", "Base_material": "Polystyrene", "Surface_treatment": "None", "Coating": "None", "Number_of_replicates": "7", "Summary": " We compared the patterns of bacterial attachment to the 26 natural surfaces against TopoChip imprints.

On the hortensia and red rose surfaces, bacteria attached mainly on the grooves next to the folds. The holy lotus surface, however, showed significantly high bacterial attachment. Similarly, high bacterial attachment and distribution were observed in the reedmace and rice surfaces. In contrast, the onion surface exhibited reduced bacterial attachment, with preferable bacterial adhesion along its grooves. As for the insects\u2019 surfaces, we observed similar bacterial attachment as on flat surfaces, with only a mild decrease on the cicada orange surface."}]}
