It contains a library of 2176 distinct subcellular chemical patterns created using mathematical algorithms and a straightforward UV-induced two-step surface modification. This approach enables the immobilization of ligands in geometrically defined regions onto cell culture substrates. To validate the system, binary RGD/polyethylene glycol patterns are prepared on which human mesenchymal stem cells are cultured, and the authors observe how different patterns affect cell and organelle morphology. As proof of concept, the cells are stained for the mechanosensitive YAP protein, and, using a machine-learning algorithm, it is demonstrated that cell shape and YAP nuclear translocation correlate. It is concluded that the Galapagos chip is a versatile platform to screen geometrical aspects of cell\u2013ECM interaction.", "Study_design": {"CellCulture": {"Name": "Cell culture", "Cell_type": "hMSC", "Passage_number": "5", "Medium": {"Type": "Basic medium", "Medium": "alpha-MEM (Life technologies)", "Serum": "10% Fetal Bovine Serum", "Antibiotics": "1% Penicillin and 1% Streptomycin", "Medium_components": "Ascorbic acid", "Medium_components_concentration": "0.2 mM"}}, "BiomaterialsScreen": {"Name": "Biomaterials screen", "Type": "Galapagos Chip", "Design": "Chemical micropatterning of surface", "Feature scale": "micrometer", "Base material": "vinyl-silane-functionalized glass substrate", "Summary": "We investigated how micropatterns can control mechanotransduction by staining three of its molecular players: paxillin which stains FAs, F-actin, and the mechanosensitive YAP.

On the uniformly grafted RGD surfaces, paxillin-stained FAs were not restricted and relatively long (up to 20 \u00b5m long) and extensive actin stress fibers were observed, which indicates mature FAs and high cytoskeletal tension in the cells. However, on Galapagos chip islands, FA formation was restricted to the underlying RGD pattern, and FA length depended on pattern dimension. FAs appeared most prominent on the edge of the RGD patterns when located on cell borders, regardless of the pattern size. Also, we noted that most cells on the pattern had actin stress fibers, and on the merged image, actin stress fiber ends colocalized with the FA edges. We observed less intense, more peripheral FAs and more cortical actin in the hMSCs cultured on small patterns with high inter-pattern distance, which implies that these had less cytoskeleton tension."}, "CellPaintAssayResults": {"Name": "Cell paint assay results", "Description": "The cells only attached and extended along the RGD patterns, avoiding the antifouling PEG polymer region. Cells on smaller microislands show smaller protrusions compared to the cells on the bigger micropatterns and thus induce different cell morphologies. Besides the evident changes in cell morphologies, we observed differences in subcellular traits with the CellPainting assay, which stains seven subcellular structures: DNA, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, F-actin, the plasma membrane, nucleoli, and mitochondria."}, "LiveDeadAssayResults": {"Name": "Live dead assay results", "Description": "We checked cell viability in the Galapagos chip to test the biocompatibility of the platform.
