Undifferentiated TSCs were seeded on a TopoChip containing 2176 different topographies in culture medium without differentiation factors, then monitored cell morphology and the levels of ICAM-1, a marker of FRC differentiation. We identified 112 and 72 surfaces that upregulated and downregulated, respectively, ICAM-1 expression. By monitoring cell morphology, and expression of the FRC differentiation marker ICAM-1 via image analysis and machine learning, we discovered correlations between ICAM-1 expression, cell shape and design of surface topographies and confirmed our findings by using flow cytometry.", "Study_design": [{"Name": "Cell culture", "Cell_type": "Stromal cells", "Passage_number": "Unknown", "Medium": {"Start_ampule": {"Type": "N/A", "Medium": "N/A", "Serum": "N/A", "Antibiotics": "N/A", "Medium_components": "N/A", "Medium_components_concentration": "N/A"}, "Seeding_medium": {"Type": "alpha-MEM", "Medium": "alpha-MEM", "Serum": "10% FBS", "Antibiotics": "N/A", "Medium_components": "N/A", "Medium_components_concentration": "N/A"}}}, {"Name": "Biomaterials screen", "Type": "TopoChip screen", "Design": "Surfaces", "Feature_scale": "Micrometer", "Base_material": "Polystyrene", "Surface_treatment": "Oxygen-plasma", "Coating": "None", "Number_of_replicates": "8", "Summary": "To evaluate the response of TSCs to surface topography, we seeded cells on O2-plasma treated polystyrene TopoChips, and cultured them for 48 h in basic medium and stained them with phalloidin and DAPI to visualize the cytoskeleton and nuclei, respectively."}, {"Name": "Imaging experiment", "Type": "Hamamatsu Nanozoomer Slide Scanner II", "Date": "N/A", "Labels": {"Label_1": {"First_antibody": "Alkaline Phosphatase antibody", "Second_antibody": "AF-594 goat anti-mouse", "Target": "Human alkaline phospatase", "Fluorescent dye": "Alexa 594", "Excitation_wavelength": "590", "Emission_wavelength": "617"}, "Label_2": {"First_antibody": "Phalloidin-488", "Second_antibody": "None", "Target": "F-actin / cytoskelet", "Fluorescent dye": "Alexa 488", "Excitation_wavelength": "495", "Emission_wavelength": "519"}, "Label_3": {"First_antibody": "Anti-ICAM1 antibody", "Second_antibody": "N/A", "Target": "ICAM1", "Fluorescent dye": "N/A", "Excitation_wavelength": "N/A", "Emission_wavelength": "N/A"}}, "Channel_names": "DAPI, Alexa 488 -n"}, {"Name": "Surface validation experiment", "Number_selected_surfaces": "4", "Feature_id": "2100,882,380,1859", "Feature_id_images": ["2100", "882", "380", "1859"], "Surface_id": "T2_PS_0344,T2_PS_0708,T2_PS_2216,T2_PS_1054"}, {"Name": "qPCR experiment", "Type": "RT-qPCR", "Cell_type": "TSCs", "Time_point(s)": "Unknown", "Read_outs": "ICAM1,VCAM-1, IL7, and CCL5"}, {"Name": "Flow cytometry experiment", "Machine": "FACS Calibur", "Cell_seeding_density": "Unknown", "Culture_time": "Unknown", "Medium": "Unkown", "Staining": "To characterize surface markers, we used the following antibodies CD105, CD90, CD11b, CD19, CD45 (R&D Systems), and CD34 (Abcam).", "Number_of_replicates": "Unknown"}], "Study_results": [{"Name": "Surface validation results", "Description": "Similar to the screening data, the ICAM-1 expression levels on the larger surfaces were also different on ICAM-1High and ICAM-1Low topographies.
