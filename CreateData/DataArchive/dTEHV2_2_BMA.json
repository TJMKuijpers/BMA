Transcatheter valve implantation has emerged as a valid alternative to conventional surgery, in particular for elderly high-risk patients. However, currently used bioprosthetic transcatheter valves are prone to progressive dysfunctional degeneration, limiting their use in younger patients. To overcome these limitations, the concept of tissue engineered heart valves with self-repair capacity has been introduced as next-generation technology.", "Study_design": [{"Name": "Animal implantation", "Implantation_method": "Minimally invasive implantation", "Implantation_procedure": "Transapical", "Implantation_location": "Pulmonary", "Scaffold": "PGA/P4HB", "Stent_present": "Yes", "Stent_type": "Nitinol", "Scaffold_design_class": "Old design", "Animal_model": "Sheep"}, {"Name": "Tissue Engineered Heart Valves", "Number_of_samples": "17", "Mesh": {"Material": "Non-woven polyglycolic-acid", "Abbreviation": "PGA", "Thickness": "1.0 mm"}, "Specific_gravity": "70 mg/cm3", "Coating": {"Name": "poly-4-hydroxybutyrate", "Abbreviation": "P4HB", "Manufacturer": "TEPHA inc.", "Country": "USA"}, "Sew": {"Name": "Unknown", "Manufacturer": "Unknown", "Country": "Unknown"}, "Stent": {"Present": "Yes", "Stent_type": "Nitinol", "Stent_length": "27 mm", "Outside_diameter": "30 mm", "Manufacturer": "Pfm-AG", "Country": "Germany"}, "Cell_seeding": {"Cells_seeded": "Yes", "Cell_type": "Ovine vascular derived cells", "Organism": "Ovine", "Cell_Passage": "6", "Seeding_density": "1.5*10^6 cells/cm2", "Seeding_carrier": "Fibrin"}, "Images": ["dTEHVS1_implant.png", " dTEHVs1_transapical_scheme.png"]}, {"Name": "Decullularized TEHVs", "Solution": "Triton X-100, Sodium deoxycholate, EDTA", "Nucleic_removal_solution": "TRIS-HCL + Benzonase"}, {"Name": "ImmunoHistology", "Aim": "Assess phenotype of infiltrated cells in explants.", "Read_outs": "alpha-smooth muscle actin, Vimentin, CD31", "First_antibody": {"Name": "alpha-SMA", "Code": "clone 1A4", "Manufacturer": "Sigma", "Country": "USA"}, "Second_antibody": {"Name": "Vimentin", "Code": "Clone Bim 3B4", "Manufacturer": "DakoCytomation", "Country": "Denmark"}, "Third_antibody": {"Name": "anti-CD31 antibody", "Code": "ab28364", "Manufacturer": "Abcam", "Country": "UK"}}, {"Name": "Scanning Electron Microscope", "Samples_imaged": "Control and decellularized TEHVs", "Read_outs": "Valvular surface morphology"}, {"Name": "Biochemical Assay", "Read_outs": "DNA content, sGAGs, Hydroxyproline"}, {"Name": "Histology experiment", "Staining": "Hematoxylin and Eosin, Verhoeff van Gieson, Von Kossa ", "Read_outs": "Tissue morphology, collagen fibers, elastic fibers, calcification"}], "Study_results": [{"Name": "Implantation results", "Number_implants_at_start": "12", "Perioperative_morbidity": "No", "Perioperative_mortality": "Yes", "Implantation_all_valves_success": "Yes", "Successful_implanted_valves": "12"}, {"Name": "In vivo performance", "Number_implants_start": "12", "Number_implants_end": "10", "Animals_euthanized": "2", "Euthanization_time": "24 hours", "Reason_euthanization": "Valve migration into the right ventricular outflow tract"}, {"Name": "ImmunoHistology results", "Leaflet region": "Alpha-SMA expression increased from 16 to 24 weeks.", "Hinge region": "Alpha-SMA expression decreased from 16 to 24 weeks.", "Wall region": "Alpha-SMA expression decreased from 8 to 16 weeks, and even further from 16 to 24 weeks."}, {"Name": "Histology experiment results", "Summary": "Both collagen and ECM are present."}, {"Name": "Macroscopic appearance", "Summary": "Implanted in vitro grown homologous TEHV revealed thin and shiny tissue formation in both valvular wall and leaflets.
