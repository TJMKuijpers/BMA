The overall metabolic activity of bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells is measured to show the functionality of the TopoWellPlate as a screening tool, which showed a 2.5-fold difference range in metabolic activity per cell. TopoWellPlates of this and other topographical designs can be used to analyze cells using the wealth of standardized molecular assays available and thus disclose the mechanisms of biomaterials-induced mechanotransduction.", "Study_design": [{"Name": "Cell culture", "Cell_type": "hMSC", "Passage_number": "5", "Medium": {"Start_ampule": {"Type": "hMSC proliferation medium", "Medium": "a-MEM medium", "Serum": "10% fetal bovine serum", "Antibiotics": "100 units/mL penicilin with 100 mg/mL streptomycin", "Medium_components": "Ascorbic acid, L-glutamine, basic fibroblast growth factor", "Medium_components_concentration": "0.2*10^-3 M, 2*10^-3 M, 1ng/mL"}, "Seeding_medium": {"Type": "basic medium", "Medium": "n/a", "Serum": "n/a", "Antibiotics": "n/a", "Medium_components": "n/a", "Medium_components_concentration": "n/a"}}}, {"Name": "Biomaterials screen", "Type": "TopoWellPlate", "Design": "Surface", "Feature_scale": "Micrometer", "Base_material": "Polystyrene", "Surface_treatment": "None", "Coating": "None", "Number_of_replicates": "4", "Summary": "Topographically enhanced areas of the polystyrene films were exactly aligned with the chimneys of a bottomless 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One) and an in-house developed aluminum controlled heat transmitting stamp. This resulted in a polystyrene 96-well plate with 87 wells that were enhanced with a surface topography and 9 wells that remained unpatterned. The TopoWellPlate is envisioned to be used as high-throughput system to study the influence of surface topography on cell behavior with non-imaging-based techniques. To show this potential, we performed a biochemical assay on the culture medium of all individual TopoUnits.
