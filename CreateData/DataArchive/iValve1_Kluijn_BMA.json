Current strategies to create such valves, however, require the use of cells for in vitro culture, or decellularized human- or animal-derived donor tissue for in situ engineering. Here, we propose and demonstrate proof-of-concept of in situ heart valve tissue engineering using a synthetic approach, in which a cell-free, slow degrading elastomeric valvular implant is populated by endogenous cells to form new valvular tissue inside the heart. We designed a fibrous valvular scaffold, fabricated from a novel supramolecular elastomer, that enables endogenous cells to enter and produce matrix. Orthotopic implantations as pulmonary valve in sheep demonstrated sustained functionality up to 12 months, while the implant was gradually replaced by a layered collagen and elastic matrix in pace with cell-driven polymer resorption. Our results offer new perspectives for endogenous heart valve replacement starting from a readily-available synthetic graft that is compatible with surgical and transcatheter implantation procedures.", "Study_design": [{"Name": "Animal implantation", "Implantation_method": "Surgically implantation", "Implantation_procedure": "Transapical", "Implantation_location": "Pulmonary position", "Scaffold": "PCL-BisUrea", "Stent_present": "Yes", "Stent_type": "PEEK ring", "Scaffold_design_class": "Not specified", "Animal_model": "Sheep"}, {"Name": "Tissue Engineered Heart Valves", "Number_of_samples": "11", "Mesh": {"Material": "Bisurea-modified polycarbonate polymer", "Abbreviation": "PC-BU", "Thickness": "0.4 mm"}, "Specific_gravity": "N/A", "Coating": {"Name": "Fibrin", "Abbreviation": "Fb", "Manufacturer": "N/A", "Country": "N/A"}, "Sew": {"Name": "Prolene 6-0", "Manufacturer": "Ethicon, Johnson & Johnson Medical", "Country": "USA"}, "Stent": {"Present": "Yes", "Stent_type": "PEEK ring", "Stent_length": "N/A", "Outside_diameter": "20 mm", "Manufacturer": "N/A", "Country": "N/A"}, "Images": ["iValve1_surgical.png", "iValve1_surgical_scheme.png"]}, {"Name": "ImmunoHistology", "Aim": "To quantify \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) expression per area, a total of 7 areas, in the center of the scaffold, over the total length of the leaflet were analyzed, from the base to the tip of the leaflet.", "Read_outs": "Alpha-smooth muscle actin", "First_antibody": {"Name": "4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole", "Code": "DAPI", "Manufacturer": "Thermo Fischer", "Country": "USA"}, "Second_antibody": {"Name": "Alexa fluor 488", "Code": "Alexa488", "Manufacturer": "Thermo Fischer", "Country": "USA"}, "Third_antibody": {"Name": "Alexa Fluor 555", "Code": "Alexa555", "Manufacturer": "Thermo Fischer", "Country": "USA"}}, {"Name": "Scanning Electron Microscope", "Samples_imaged": "Implants", "Read_outs": "Neo-tissue coverage, degradation of scaffold fibers, endothelialization of TEHVs."}, {"Name": "Biochemical Assay", "Read_outs": "DNA content, sGAGs, hydroxyproline, elastin."}, {"Name": "Histology experiment", "Staining": "Hematoxylin and Eosin, Masson's Trichrome, Rusell-Movat Pentachrome, Picrosirius Red, Alizarin Red.
