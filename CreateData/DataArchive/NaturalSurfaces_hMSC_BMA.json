Natural surfaces occupy a clearly different area of distribution to the TopoChip surfaces. The TopoChip platform is currently the largest collection of topographies with 2176 in silico designed microtopographies. Through machine-learning algorithms, it is demonstrated that natural surfaces extend the design space of the TopoChip, which coincides with distinct morphological and focal adhesion profiles in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs cultured on flat surfaces exhibit a strong presence of F-Actin stress fibers and mature focal adhesion sites. MSCs grown on the onion surface demonstrated a reduction in F-Actin stress fibers and the presence of immature focal adhesions at the periphery of the cell. Diffuse F-Actin stress fibers were observed in MSCs grown on the hortensia, and red rose, with few focal adhesions. Short but visible F-Actin stress fibers were present in MSCs cultured on the holy lotus surface. A strong presence of immature dot-like focal adhesions in MSCs cultured on the holy lotus surface. It has been demonstrated that both actin/myosin tension and FAK signaling are implicated in cell differentiation. Therefore, these observations can shed some light in determining how natural topographies guide MSC differentiation.", "Study_design": [{"Name": "Cell culture", "Cell_type": "hMSC", "Passage_number": "N/A", "Medium": {"Type": "MEM alpha-glutaMax", "Medium": "Basic medium for adipose-derived hMSC", "Serum": "10% Fetal bovine serum", "Antibiotics": "Penicillin, Streptomyci", "Medium_components": "Ascorbic-acid-2-phosphate", "Medium_components_concentration": "10000"}}, {"Name": "Biomaterials screen", "Type": "Natural surface screen", "Design": "Surface", "Feature_scale": "Micrometer", "Base_material": "Polystyrene", "Surface_treatment": "N/A", "Coating": "N/A", "Number_of_replicates": "7", "Summary": "We selected 16 plant and ten insect surfaces with a diverse set of surface properties based on reported phenomena such as superhydrophilicity, antifouling, or light reflection.
