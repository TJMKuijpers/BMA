                <p class='card-text' style="font-size: 16px;">The Biomaterial Atlas is a repository with data on biomaterial–cell interactions from a multi-disciplinary field. It contains information on biomaterial properties for regulating cell-material interactions, mechanical factors influencing soft tissue, and surface topologies to control cell fate. The creation of biomaterials suited for clinical application is a major challenge because of our current knowledge gap on cellular interactions and biomaterial characteristics. The Biomaterials Atlas offers a repository to explore those interactions, to further investigate the role of material on cellular response and characteristics. The scope of the Biomaterials Atlas is to collect data and provide researchers with existing knowledge to define new hypotheses.</p>

                        <p class='card-body-researchline-text'>The research group investigates the interplay between living cells and the mechanobiological cues originating from the extracellular matrix under conditions of tissue growth, adaptation, regeneration and degeneration. For this, the group uses ‘living’ model systems (cell, cell-matrix, engineered tissue, native tissue) to quantify and understand these aspects at different levels of complexity. The obtained fundamental knowledge is translated into engineering approaches to restore or regenerate living tissues, in particular for the human heart. A prominent example is the development of a synthetic, biodegradable heart valve prosthesis that seduces the body to create a new, living heart valve at the site of implantation. Along this line, novel developments concentrate on the in situ tissue engineering of coronary arteries and vascular access grafts.
                        Another important research topic focuses on restoring tissue organization in compromised myocardium and other soft tissues. This research aims to understand extracellular matrix synthesis and remodeling under mechanical loading conditions and in the presence of degradable scaffolds using platforms of miniaturized heart tissues.

                        More and more materials are developed for regenerative medicine purposes. However, understanding exactly how cells interact with biomaterials is still work in progress. One of the materials properties important in cell-material interaction is surface structure, and to study this, we developed the TopoChip (below). The TopoChip is a high-throughput platform to screen bio-active surface topographies for their effect on cellular processes.
                        In order to fit the application of interest, we can produce TopoChips from a wide of materials via a streamlined cleanroom production line. Furthermore, we have already shown the bio-active capacity of our defined surface topographies for many cell types and for diverse cellular processes.

                        The Biomaterials research group focusses on the design and synthesis of bioinspired functional biomaterials. The main goals are: 1. To develop methods to specifically modify biomaterials surfaces, and 2. To translate these biomaterials to applications in the field of regenerative medicine, with a focus on cardiovascular and renal applications.
                        The biomedical application of different supramolecular polymeric biomaterials held together via directed, non-covalent interactions is the central theme. In the cardiovascular field the aim is to develop vascular grafts and heart valves that in situ can be engineered by selective capturing of progenitor cells from the blood. Additionally, catheter-delivery methods of various drugs, cells and exosomes, encapsulated in hydrogels, to the heart after myocardial infarction are investigated. Furthermore, the Biomaterials research group also designs and develops biomaterials to intervene in processes related to kidney disease. In order to ameliorate hemodialysis bilayered supramolecular membranes on which kidney cells can be cultured outside the body are developed.
