# BMA
This is a dev repo of the CBITE biomaterial atlas repo

The database will be build with MongoDB
The server side will be implemented with Nodejs
Front-end will be developed with angularjs

<h3> Add a new document to the database </h3>
There are two in-house developed templates (Jupyter notebooks) provided to either add a biomaterials screen or heart valve study. This can be found in the subfolder createData. Both notebooks will have multiple input fields which ask the user to give information as text input. Once finished, the gathered information will be processed into a json object and saved to the local folder.
